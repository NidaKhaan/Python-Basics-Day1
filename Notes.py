""" Variables and Data Types
Variables are named containers that store values. Python determines the type of a value at runtime, making it dynamically typed. Common data types include integers, floats, strings, and booleans. """
""" Conditionals and Loops
Conditionals (if, elif, else) control the flow based on boolean expressions. Loops (for, while) repeat actions until a condition changes or a sequence ends. """
""" Functions (args, kwargs)"""
""" Functions encapsulate reusable logic. Positional arguments (args) and keyword arguments (**kwargs) give flexibility in how functions are called. """

""" Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
Python provides several built-in collection types to organize and manage data efficiently.

List: ordered, mutable sequence

Tuple: ordered, immutable sequence

Set: unordered collection of unique elements

Dictionary: key-value mapping """

""" List Comprehension and Set Comprehension
Comprehensions provide concise syntax for creating lists or sets based on existing iterables with optional filtering. """

""" String Formatting (f-strings, .format)
String formatting techniques allow embedding values into strings dynamically. """
